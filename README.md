# TUM Exam Statistic Parser

Are you a student at the Technical University Munich (TUM) in Germany? Want to see how well you performed in comparison to your classmates?
Parse your exam results with this python program and let it tell you!

## Prerequisites

If you have not yet installed python, I would recommend using the [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution as it contains all necessary libraries.
Otherwise you will need to install 

- python 2.7
- beautifulsoup


## Getting started

### Clone the project
Clone the [TUM-exam-statistic-parser](https://github.com/timbrgr/TUM-exam-statistic-parser) repository using [git](http://git-scm.com/):

```
git clone https://github.com/timbrgr/TUM-exam-statistic-parser.git
cd TUM-exam-statistic-parser
```

### Get the data

Unfortunately there is no automatic way to download your exam statistics (yet). 

Login to your TUMonline account and download the statistics via *"Exam Results" -> Choose an exam -> "Statistical evaluation
of exam results"	-> right-click & save html file* for all the exams you want to analyize.

### Start the script
